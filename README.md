# TiledRSoXS
A somewhat general IgorPro based browser for Tiled.  Built for RSoXS, but useful in general

todo:  
1.) ~~primary and monitor selection should be with a list box~~

2.) baseline and metadata display...
  graphs for baselines, to see changes in some values?
  listbox display of metadata... columns for different scans?
  
3.) QANT import.  all the data is there, just need to copy it to the right folder for QANT to see it.

4.) NIKA integration??  not convinced it is needed, but perhaps mask / beam centering tools?

5.) live mode.
  disable paging buttons and search? always load the last n-10 scans, select the most recent scan (allow selection of others, but most recent is required)
  update the scan list every 2 seconds, monitors, primary and images every 5 seconds
  
6.) smart loading depending on which tab is selected... skip images if not in the images tab, skip monitors unless on primary or monitors tab
