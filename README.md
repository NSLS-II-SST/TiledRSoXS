# TiledRSoXS
A somewhat general IgorPro based browser for Tiled.  Built for RSoXS, but useful in general.  Please report any issues to egann@bnl.gov.

# Installation:  
For now, just load the procedure file, and a menu item will be added RSoXS->TiledRSoXS which will launch tiled RSoXS.  It is of limited use at the moment, because it requires 1.) an apikey - you are on your own generating that.  and 2.) tunneling into the tiled server (assuming you are using NSLS-II).  I will not be providing support for either of these necessary steps, unfortunately.  Soon it will be opened up such that both of these requirements will be easier.  For now, this can be used within the NSLS-II network and assuming you have finangled an apikey yourself, (or of course you have your own tiled server that you control)
